# MSSA: Monte-Carlo Unit Circle Simulation
 The Monte Carlo method allows us to make estimations based on large samples of data, by sampling random and unbiased
 subsets. For example, if we wanted to figure out the average height of every person in the world, we 
 obviously wouldn't go around getting every single persons height, there are simply too many people in the world.
 Instead, we can take a random group and average their height, hoping that it is close to the average of the whole
 world. By taking samples from a larger and larger group, the accuracy generally increases.
 A common use of the Monte Carlo method in programming is calculating the lighting of 3d space.
